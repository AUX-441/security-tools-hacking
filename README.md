## üöÄ Features

- Modular architecture for flexible testing
Each component (system information collection, browser history extraction, geolocation, screenshots, webcam capture, and key logging) is designed as a separate module, allowing independent execution and testing.

- Reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation modules
The tool provides reconnaissance features such as gathering system details, network info, and user activity data, enabling in-depth analysis in a controlled and ethical environment.

- High scalability for custom scripts and integrations
Designed to be easily extended, you can add custom scripts or integrate additional modules for monitoring, automation, or educational security testing.

- Designed specifically for Windows penetration testing
All modules are optimized for Windows environments, including support for native commands, registry queries, and browser-specific data extraction.

- Ideal for red team operations and ethical hacking
Provides a safe framework to practice penetration testing, simulate attacks, or analyze system security in controlled labs.

- Security automation tools for faster workflow
Automates repetitive tasks like screenshot capture, logging, and browser history collection, streamlining security assessment workflows.
